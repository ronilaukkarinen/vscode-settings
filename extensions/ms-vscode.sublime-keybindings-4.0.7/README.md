# Sublime Importer for VS Code

This extension imports keybindings and settings from Sublime Text to VS Code.

## Getting Started
### Keymappings
This extension ports the most popular Sublime Text keyboard shortcuts to Visual Studio Code.  
Just restart VS Code after the installation of this extension and your favorite Sublime Text keyboard shortcuts will be available in VS Code. 
### Importing settings
The first time the extension is launched a prompt is shown that lets you import your Sublime Settings.  
If you want to import your settings at a later time use the `Sublime Text Keymap: Import Sublime Text Settings` command from the Command Palette (F1).
