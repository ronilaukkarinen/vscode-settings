# WordPress Hook Autocompletion for VS Code

This extension adds autocomplete support for WordPress action and filter names.

Last updated for WordPress 5.4 beta.

## Usage

Start typing the name of a WordPress action or filter within `add_action()` or `add_filter()` and you'll get an autocomplete list of all matching actions or filters, plus information about the parameters and usage:

Autocomplete is also provided for the callback function and other built-in callbacks to save you keystrokes:

An autocompleted closure callback looks like this:

```php
add_filter( 'template_directory', function( $template_dir, $template, $theme_root ) {
    |
}, 10, 3 );
```
