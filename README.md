# The ultimate VSCode config and theme by rolle

This repository contains my Visual Studio Code settings used when coding [Digitoimisto Dude Oy's Projects](https://github.com/digitoimistodude). Strongly WIP.

## Features

### Useful extensions

### Snippets

Useful snippets like `media + tab` for media queries. Browse snippets [here](https://github.com/ronilaukkarinen/vscode-settings/tree/master/snippets).

### Key bindings

Useful keybindings for different kind of tasks. Browse keybindings [here](https://github.com/ronilaukkarinen/vscode-settings/keybindings.json).

### Pixel-perfect theme

Theme is based on Monokai Extended, Spacegray and Synthwave '84. Color overrides are achieved via settings.json so no actual theme is needed, just activate Monokai Extended, Synthwave '84 Neon Dreams and you are good to go.
