# [1.8.0](https://github.com/streetsidesoftware/vscode-spell-checker/compare/v1.8.0-alpha.2...v1.8.0) (2020-02-23)

Performance enhancements and a few features.

## `enableFiletypes`
Fixes [#408](https://github.com/streetsidesoftware/vscode-spell-checker/issues/408) :
A new setting `enableFiletypes` will add the listed filetypes to `enableLanguageIds`.

Example:

```
"cSpell.enableFiletypes": [
  "jupyter", "kotlin", "kotlinscript", "!json"
]
```

will **enable** Jupyter, Kotlin, KotlinScript and **disable** JSON files.

## `${workspaceFolder}` substitution in paths and globs

Relative paths were difficult to get working when specified in VS Code settings. It wasn't clear what they should be relative to. Relative paths to a `cspell.json` files are clear.

It is now possible to have the following setting in VS Code preferences.

```
"cSpell.import": [
  "${workspaceFolder}/node_modules/company_standards/cspell.json"
]
```

for a multiroot with folders `client`, `server`, `common`, it is possible to specify the name of the folder:

```
"ignorePaths": [
  "${workspaceFolder:client}/**/*.json"
],
"cSpell.import": [
  "${workspaceFolder:server}/node_modules/company_standards/cspell.json"
],
"cSpell.dictionaryDefinitions": [
  {
    "name": "Company Terms",
    "path": "${workspaceFolder:common}/dictionaries/terms.txt"
  }
],
"cSpell.dictionaries": ["Company Terms"]
```
