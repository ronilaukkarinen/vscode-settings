Offline HTML5 validator. Validates either a full document or a smaller
(incomplete) template, e.g. from an AngularJS or React component.

## Features

- Can test fragments of HTML, for instance a component template.
- Does not upload any data to a remote server, all testing is done locally.
- Strict and non-forgiving parsing. It will not try to correct any incorrect
  markup or guess what it should do.

## Usage

    npm install -g html-validate
    html-validate FILENAME..

## Configuration

Create `.htmlvalidate.json`:

```js
{
  "extends": [
    "htmlvalidate:recommended"
  ],

  "rules": {
    "close-order": "error"
    "void": ["warn", {"style": "omit"}]
  }
}
```

## Example

```html
<p>
  <button>Click me!</button>
  <div id="show-me">
    Lorem ipsum
  </div>
</p>
```

```text
  1:1  error  Element <p> is implicitly closed by adjacent <div>  no-implicit-close
  2:2  error  Button is missing type attribute                    button-type
  6:4  error  Unexpected close-tag, expected opening tag          close-order
```

    npm run lint

or call `eslint` or `tslint` directly.
