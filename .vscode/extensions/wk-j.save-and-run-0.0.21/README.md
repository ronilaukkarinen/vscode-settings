## Run saved file in Terminal

Fork from [vscode-runonsave](https://github.com/emeraldwalk/vscode-runonsave)

Simplify original extension by pass command into Terminal directly without spawn process, so we don't lose output colors.

## Features

- Configure multiple commands that run when a file is saved
- Regex pattern matching for files that trigger commands running

## Configuration

Add "saveAndRun" configuration to user or workspace settings.

- "commands" - Array of commands that will be run whenever a file is saved.
  - "match" - A regex for matching which files to run commands on
  - "cmd" - Command to run. Can include parameters that will be replaced at runtime (see Placeholder Tokens section below).
  - "useShortcut" - Execute file with shortcut key `Command + Shift + R`

## Sample Config

```json
"saveAndRun": {
  "commands": [
    {
      "match": ".*",
      "cmd": "echo 'I run for all files.'",
      "useShortcut": false,
      "silent": false
    },
    {
      "match": "\\.txt$",
      "cmd": "echo 'I am a .txt file ${file}.'",
      "useShortcut": false,
      "silent": false
    }
  ]
}
```
