# Contributing to Web Accessibility

:sparkles: First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute!:sparkles:

Now, take a moment to be sure your contributions make sense to everyone else.
These are just guidelines, not rules.
Use your best judgment, and feel free to propose changes to this document in a pull request.

## How can I contribute?

### Improve documentation

As a developer, you're the perfect candidate to help us improve our documentation. Typo corrections, error fixes, better explanations, more examples, etc. Open issues for things that could be improved. Anything. Even improvements to this document.

### Improve issues

Some issues are created with missing information, not reproducible, or plain invalid. Help make them easier to resolve. Handling issues takes a lot of time that we would rather spend on fixing bugs and adding features.

## Reporting Issues

- Found a problem? Want a new feature? First of all, see if your issue or idea has [already been reported](https://github.com/mvdschee/web-accessibility/issues).
- If not, just open a [new clear and descriptive issue](https://github.com/mvdschee/web-accessibility/issues/new).
- Use a clear and descriptive title.
- Include as much information as possible: Steps to reproduce the issue, error message, Browser version, operating system, etc.
- The more time you put into an issue, the more we will.

## Submitting pull requests

- Non-trivial changes are often best discussed in an issue first, to prevent you from doing unnecessary work.
- For ambitious tasks, you should try to get your work in front of the reviewers for feedback as soon as possible. Open a pull request as soon as you have done the minimum needed to demonstrate your idea. At this early stage, don't worry about making things perfect, or 100% complete. Add a [WIP] prefix to the title, and describe what you still need to do. This lets reviewers know not to nit-pick small details or point out improvements you already know you need to make.
- New features should be accompanied with tests and documentation.
- Don't include unrelated changes.
- Lint and test before submitting the pull request.
- Make the pull request from a **feature branch** to dev branch.
- Use a clear and descriptive title for the pull request and commits.
- You might be asked to do changes to your pull request. There's never a need to open another pull request. [Just update the existing one.](https://github.com/RichardLitt/docs/blob/master/amending-a-commit-guide.md)
