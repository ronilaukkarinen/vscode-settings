# Purpose

This project includes a variety of tslint rules we have found useful for our projects.

# Usage

Install from npm to your devDependencies  (https://www.npmjs.com/package/vrsource-tslint-rules)

```
npm install --save-dev vrsource-tslint-rules
```

Configure tslint to use the vrsource-tslint-rules folder:

Add `"vrsource-tslint-rules"` to the `extends` array of your `tslint.json` file:

```
{
   "rulesDirectory": ["vrsource-tslint-rules/rules"]
   "rules": {
     ...
   }
}
```

Now configure some of the new rules.

# Rules

## conditional-expression-parens

Rule to enforce the use of parentheses each clause of a conditional when they
are not simple expressions of a single indentifier or calling expression.

```javascript
"conditional-expression-parens": true
```

## ext-variable-name

This rule provides extensive support for customizing allowable variable names
for a wide variety of variable tags.  The rule is configured by setting up a
list of sub-rules that specify the tags of variables to check and the checks
to perform on the variable's name.  The sub-rules are checked in order
and the first one that matches the tags of variable being checked is the
only one that is used.

An example set of sub-rules for an example coding standard is shown below.

```json
"ext-variable-name": [
   true,
   ["class",                 "pascal"],
   ["interface",             "pascal", {"regex": "^I.*$"}],
   ["parameter",             "camel"],
   ["property", "static",    "camel", {"regex": "^s.*$"}],
   ["property", "private",   "camel", "require-leading-underscore"],
   ["property", "protected", "camel", "allow-leading-underscore"],
   ["variable", "local",     "snake"],
   ["variable", "const",     "upper"],
   ["variable",              "camel", {"regex": "^g.*$"}],
   ["method", "private",     "camel", "require-leading-underscore"],
   ["method", "protected",   "camel", "allow-leading-underscore"],
   ["function",              "camel"],
   ["default",               "camel"]
]
```

Allowed tags for variables:
   * primary (choose one):
      * class, interface, parameter, property,
        method, function, variable
   * modifiers (choose zero or more):
      * local, const, static, public, protected, private

note: If any tags is added to a sub-rule then **all** must match the variable.

Checks allowed:
   * One of:
      * "camel": Require variables to use camelCaseVariables
      * "snake": Require variables to use snake_case_variables
      * "pascal": Require variables to use PascalCaseVariables
      * "upper": Require variables to use UPPER_CASE_VARIABLES
   * "allow-leading-underscore": permits the variable to have a leading underscore
   * "allow-trailing-underscore": permits the variable to have a trailing underscore
   * "require-leading-underscore": requires the variable to have a leading underscore
   * "require-trailing-underscore": requires the variable to have a trailing underscore
   * "ban-keywords": bans a list of language keywords from being used
   * {"regex": "^.*$"}: checks the variable name against the given regex

## literal-spacing

Rule to enforce consistent spacing inside array and object literals.

See: eslint: object-curly-spacing and array-bracket-spacing

```javascript
"literal-spacing": [
    true,
    {
        "array": ["always"],
        "object": ["never"],
        "import": ["always"]
    }
]
```

## max-params

Rule to enforce a maximum number of parameters for functions and methods.

```javascript
"max-params": [
    true,
    3
]
```

## multiline-arrow

Rule to enforce various checks arrow functions that span multiple lines.

```javascript
"multiline-arrow": [
    true,
    "require-parens",
    "require-block"
]
```

## prefer-case-blocks

This rule checks to make sure that all case clauses use a block
around the statements of the case.  This helps to protect against
issues with lexcical declarations that would become visible to the
entire switch statement.

To maintain consistency, the rule requires a block in all cases.

```javascript
"prefer-case-blocks": true
```

## prefer-literal

Flags locations where code calls "new Object()", "new Array()", "new Function()""

```javascript
"prefer-literal": [
    true,
    "object",
    "function",
    "array"
]
```

# Development

## Development steps

The command `npm run test` will run tests locally.

To add a new rule:
  - Add the rule's .ts file to the /rules directory
  - Add one or more tests in the test/rules directory
  - Use run_tests.sh to build and run the tests
  - (optional) The .vscode directory includes settings to run and debug rules in vscode.
     - Just modify the "args" entry to point to the rule test case to run

Notes for how to build new rules and tests:
