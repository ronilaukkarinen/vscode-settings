This plugin [attempts](#known-issues) to override user/workspace settings with
settings found in `.editorconfig` files. No additional or vscode-specific files
are required. As with any EditorConfig plugin, if `root=true` is not specified,
EditorConfig [will continue to look](https://editorconfig.org/#file-location)
for an `.editorconfig` file outside of the project.

### This repository is specific to the [EditorConfig Extension for Visual Studio Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=EditorConfig.EditorConfig). Internally, it uses the [`editorconfig` npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/editorconfig), which is one of a few [EditorConfig](https://editorconfig.org) cores available.

## Installation

```
ext install EditorConfig
```

## Supported Properties

- `indent_style`
- `indent_size`

- `trim_trailing_whitespace` (on save)

## How it works

This extension is activated whenever you open a new text editor, switch tabs
into an existing one or focus into the editor you already have open. When
activated, it uses [`editorconfig`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/editorconfig)
to resolve the configuration for that particular file and applies any relevant
editor settings.

_Note: some settings can only be applied on file save, as indicated above._

A new `.editorconfig` file can be created via the Explorer sidebar's context
menu by right-clicking in the folder where you'd like it to be and selecting
`Generate .editorconfig`.

## Known Issues

- [`trim_trailing_whitespace = false` is not applied when user/workspace setting of `files.trimTrailingWhitespace` is set to `true`.](https://github.com/editorconfig/editorconfig-vscode/issues/153)
